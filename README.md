A clone of elm-vim adapted for haskell

The default indentation system on haskell files in vim was so bad it made me
feel sick just using it (literally). The elm-vim plugin indentation worked
niceley for me (well, with a personal hotfix) so I decided to adapt it for
haskell.

Since then, I can write and edit Haskell code without having to stop after 30
minutes.
